				It wasn't until the 1950's, when the surfing craze was in full 
				swing, that people realized skateboarding could recreate the 
				feeling of riding a wave. This connection with surfing gave 
				skateboarding a direction that would influence everything to 
				come, from maneuvers and style, to terrain, fashion and 
				attitude. It was during this time that modifications were made 
				to the trucks making it easier to maneuver. By 1959 the first 
				Roller Derby Skateboard was for sale.<br />

				<br />
				In the early 1960's companies such as Larry Stevenson's Makaha 
				and Hobie Alter's Hobie began to mass-produce the first true 
				surfing-inspired skateboards. Some of the early proponents of 
				surf-style skateboarding included Bill and Mark Richards, Dannu 
				Bearer, Bruce Logan and Torger Johnson. Skateboarding became 
				very popular almost overnight, and companies were fighting to 
				keep up with demand. Over fifty million skateboards were sold 
				within a three year period, and the first skateboard contest was 
				held in Hermosa Beach, CA in 1963. Then in 1965 a slew of 
				so-called safety experts pronounced skateboarding unsafe - 
				urging stores not to sell them, and parents not to buy them. The 
				skateboarding fad died as quickly as it had started, and the 
				sport entered its first slump. Skateboarding would experience 
				other slumps in its history. This pattern of peaks and valleys 
				would come to be known as the &quot;ten-year cycle,&quot; although the 
				slumps weren't exactly ten years apart. <br />

				It was during this first slump that Larry Stevenson invented the 
				kicktail, and the first generation of skateboarders laid down 
				the foundation of tricks and style. However, they were still 
				largely limited by equipment. Then in 1973 the urethane wheel 
				was invented, revolutionizing the sport. The new wheels provided 
				much better traction and speed and, combined with new skateboard 
				specific trucks, allowed skaters to push the difficulty of 
				maneuvers to new levels. Tricks at this time consisted of 
				surfing maneuvers done on flat ground or on banks. Empty 
				swimming pools and cylindrical pipes were exploited as terrain 
				for the first time. <br />
				<br />
				During the 1970's skateboarding experienced a large growth stage 
				whish saw the construction of numerous concrete skateparks, a 
				rank of professional skaters, magazines and movies. During this 
				period modern skateboarding evolved to include vertical skating 
				among its disciplines of slalom, downhill, freestyle and 
				longjump. <br />
				<br />
				Key advances in the sport included the aerial, the invert and 
				the ollie, which may be the single most important trick in the 
				evolution of skateboarding, next to the kickturn. This was the 
				first time skateboarding had stars, some of the first really big 
				names being Tony Alva, Jay Adams and Stacy Peralta. The look of 
				skateboards also changed from being six to seven inches in width 
				to over nine inches, providing better stability on vertical 
				surfaces. Near the end of the 70's, spiraling insurance and 
				slowing attendance forced all but a few skateparks out of 
				business and skateboarding entered its! Second slump. <br />

				<br />
				In the 80's the plywood ramp and streetstyle revitalized 
				skateboarding just as the urethane wheel had revitalized the 
				sport in the 70's. Forced to take an underground, do-it-yourself 
				attitude, skaters began to create their own wooden skate ramps 
				in backyards and empty lots and turn previously unrideable 
				street terrain, such as walls an handrails, into free-skate 
				parks. Skater-owned companies became the norm and innovations in 
				board and truck size allowed the trick envelope to be pushed 
				even further. This generation had its own group of skate stars, 
				some of whom still compete today including Tony Hawk and Steve 
				Caballero. Towards the end of the 80's the focus shifted to 
				street skating and Vert riding became less popular, it was the 
				era of the first street stars like Mark Gonzales, Natas Kaupas 
				and Mike Vallely. <br />
				<br />
				With all this grass-roots action taking place it was inevitable 
				that skateboarding would go through another growth phase. This 
				time the cycle peaked around 1987 after skateboarding had 
				directly influenced international culture ranging from the 
				hard-edged punk style of music that most skaters preferred to 
				the baggy, earth-tone clothes and retro tennis shoes that 
				skaters wore. <br />
				<br />
				The current cycle of skateboarding has been fueled by many items 
				including new companies, more varied and difficult terrain, a 
				new, more hard-core, almost dangerous attitude, and most 
				importantly by a new generation of kids who have discovered the 
				exhilaration feeling of rolling along of a board with wheels. 
				Some of the people who exert heavy influence on the sport are 
				former pros who have started companies like Steve Rocco of World 
				Industries. The ollie has come into its own as the foundation 
				for 80% of street tricks and about 60% of vert tricks, with the 
				focus being on more technical and larger tricks. <br />

				<br />
				In regards to the &quot;ten-year cycle,&quot; the sport once again started 
				on an upward swing in 1995, due in part to exposure it received 
				from ESPN's first Extreme Games in Rhode Island. This served to 
				bring skateboarding, which had long been viewed as a rebel 
				sport, perhaps because of the danger and occasional illegality 
				of the endeavor, a step closer to the mainstream. Many of the 
				skaters who competed felt that ESPN's coverage of the sport 
				raised skateboarding's overall image with the general public and 
				is a good thing for the future of the sport. In 1996 the Extreme 
				Games were again held in Rhode Island, once more exposing the 
				sport of skateboarding to millions of people. Skateboarding was 
				also included in the 1997 Winter X Games in the form of a 
				CrossOver event that also included in-line skating, bicycle 
				stunt, and snowboarding. <br />
				<br />
				The impact of media coverage on skateboarding has moved it from 
				an underground sport to a spectator sport over the last four 
				years. It was brought an influx of companies and their 
				advertising dollars, which had previously ignored skateboarding, 
				as a vehicle for promotional purposes. Advertisers have seen 
				that skateboarding has become a prime sport through which they 
				can reach their favorite demographic: youth males. <br />
				<br />
				Skateboarders have been present in campaigns for products from 
				soft drinks to potato chips, candy to phone companies. Thus, 
				most of what is happening in skateboarding today is coming not 
				from the skateboarders themselves, but from corporate sponsors 
				and the mass media. The primary focus of the sport remains on 
				street skating, as can be seen throughout both the editorial and 
				advertising pages of the major skateboard magazines, where 
				street skating photos continue to dominate. However vert skating 
				is making a comeback, due in part to the large number of new 
				skateparks being built. These skateparks have also given boost 
				to the skating community in many towns. The many different 
				ramps, pipes and bowls present at these parks have led to a 
				change in equipment. These technological changes applied to 
				skate products have improved skateboarding hear steadily over 
				the last two decades. While in the early 90's small boards and 
				tiny wheel ruled, now there is a wide range of boards and wheels 
				being seen under the feet of skateboarders. Wheel diameters are 
				larger, deck width continues to grow, and longboards are gaining 
				in popularity, especially in beach communities and among those 
				that just want to use their skateboards to cruise or as a mode 
				of transportation. Downhill skateboarding has also seen 
				resurgence in recent years due in part to the visibility of the 
				street luge. <br />
				<br />
				One of the biggest trends at work is among softgoods. In the 
				past, clothing fashions have consistently reflected the changes 
				influenced by those who skate. Footwear is currently getting all 
				the attention. According to the Transworld Skateboarding 
				Business Summer 1998 Retailer Survey shoes represented 26.5 % of 
				the market share, followed by decks (26%), apparel (16%), trucks 
				(11.5%), wheels (11%), and accessories (9%). <br />
				<br />
				There have been many organizations and governing bodies for 
				skateboarding throughout its history. The two main organizations 
				today are the IASC (International Association of Skateboarding 
				Companies), and World Cup Skateboarding, which is the leading 
				competition organization. World Cup Skateboarding is run by 
				former NSA (National Skateboarding Association) president Don 
				Bostick, with competitions featuring Street and Vert 
				disciplines. Competitors are usually on factory teams, rather 
				than national teams. This is due to the growth of sponsorship 
				and sponsorship dollars put into events, which has changed the 
				face of competitive skateboarding tremendously. Skateboarding is 
				beginning to earn respect as professional athletes and are 
				receiving greater amounts of purse money from contests. <br />

				<br />
				&quot;Today a pro can make anywhere from $1000 to $10,000 a month,&quot; 
				says Danielle Bostick of World Cup Skateboarding and the X 
				Games. These earnings are based on winnings, depending on how 
				well a skater places in any given competition and how many 
				competitions a skater competes in during any given month. Most 
				skaters who are sponsored also earn a monthly salary from one or 
				more companies, which sponsors them as team riders. This is a 
				considerable change from the past when pro skaters had to work a 
				regular job as well as compete according to Bostick. <br />
				<br />
				Skateboarding can be enjoyed by kids as young as two years, but 
				the majority of pro skaters' range from early teens to early 
				twenties. Most skateboarders don't train in any usual sense of 
				the word, and they don't even think about their diet. Skaters 
				just do what they love to do: skate, all the time. Skateboarding 
				is fun, and when having fun is the goal, it never seems like 
				training. Of course many skateboarders do other things for fun 
				as well, such as surfing and snowboarding, which is actually 
				extreme sports cross-training. <br />
